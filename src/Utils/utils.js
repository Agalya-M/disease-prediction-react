      "Fatigue: Fatigue is a common symptom of diabetes, which is often related to the body's inability to use glucose for energy.",
      "Blurred vision: High blood sugar levels can cause fluid to be pulled from the lenses of the eyes, causing blurred vision.",

The ducts are tubes that carry milk to the nipple. The connective tissue (which consists of fibrous and fatty tissue) surrounds and holds everything together. Most breast cancers begin in the ducts or lobules.",

      "Nipple changes: This may include a nipple that turns inward (inverted), discharge from the nipple, or a nipple that is tender or itchy.",
      "Redness or scaling of the breast skin: This may be a sign of a rare type of breast cancer called inflammatory breast cancer.",
      "It is important to note that not all lumps or changes in the breast are cancerous, and many women have benign breast conditions that are not cancer. However, if you notice any changes in your breast, it is important to see a doctor for evaluation.",
      "It is also important to get regular mammograms and to perform breast self-exams to detect any changes early. Women over 50 years old should get mammograms every two years, and those with a family history of breast cancer may need to start screening earlier or have more frequent screenings.",
